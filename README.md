## Hi!

I'm Jannes. I enjoy coding a lot and started a lot of projects so far. Most of them don't ever get finished and will probably be set to private forever. Feel free to check out any of my public repositories though.

I have worked with a lot of different languages and technologies in the past but really never settled and focused on one in particular. I have coded some PHP, C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript and C (for ArduinoIDE) but I wouldn't consider myself good in any of them.

My biggest project to date was <a href="http://cwstats.de">BCS</a>, a stats tracking website that displays clan wars stats. It had up to 400 unique vistors a day when it launched and still around 80 vistors a day when I decided to end support for it - I is still running on my server though. Overall it was a good project, sadly my lack of knowledge in databases resulted in extremely long loading times - I am actually suprised that so many people still use it (74 people yesterday 2020-07-18). You can find all its code here: <a href="https://github.com/JKamue/BCS">BCS code</a>.
